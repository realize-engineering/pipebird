**Direct, secure, and cost efficient data sharing.** Pipebird is open source infrastructure that enables businesses to share data directly to their customers' data warehouses or databases.

Once integrated, Pipebird eliminates the need for your customers to use a third-party ETL provider or build their own pipelines to access data from your product.

Offering data pipelines natively in your product:
- **minimizes security and compliance risks** created by third-parties. Launch Pipebird within your virtual cloud with the press of a button, your data never hits our servers.
- **eliminates pipeline complexity for customers and partners.** Create customer-defined pipelines directly from your product using a declarative configuration language.
- **internalizes revenue previously captured by third-party ETL providers.** Customers pay you for providing higher-quality data in a more secure manner.

We believe that native product data pipelines are the future of how companies will retrieve data from their vendors - we've already seen major companies like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/data-pipeline) and [Customer.io](https://customer.io/data-warehouse) make big investments in building out data sharing features for their customers.

Pipebird makes it easy for any company to offer customers the same powerful data sharing features in just a few of hours.
