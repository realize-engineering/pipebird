# Pipebird

## About Pipebird

Pipebird is open-source infrastructure that enables businesses to share data directly to customers' databases or data warehouses.

With Pipebird you can:
* push data directly to major data warehouses.
* create custom connectors to any source or destination.
* spec out arbitrary transformations using a powerful configuration language.


## Why use Pipebird?

Pipebird is built for developers and companies that want to securely push data to their customers' data warehouses.

Rather than using a third-party ETL provider or scraping data from APIs, your customers can pull data and apply transformations directly from your platform.

We believe that this is a more secure and efficient way for customers to get important data from your platform into their source-of-truth systems.
