## About Pipebird

Pipebird is open-source infrastructure that enables businesses to share data directly to their customers' data warehouses or databases.

Once integrated, Pipebird eliminates the need for your customers to use a third-party ETL provider or build their own pipelines to access data from your product.

Offering pipelines natively in your product minimizes security and compliance risks, eliminates complexity for customers, and allows you to internalize revenue previously captured by third-party ETL providers. Major companies like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/data-pipeline) and [Customer.io](https://customer.io/data-warehouse) have already made big investments in building out data sharing features for their customers - with Pipebird you can offer the same features in a matter of hours.

## Why use Pipebird?

Pipebird is built for developers and companies that want to securely push data to their customers' data warehouses.

Rather than using a third-party ETL provider or scraping data from APIs, your customers can pull data and apply transformations directly from your platform.

We believe that this is a more secure and efficient way for customers to get important data from your platform into their source-of-truth systems.
