### Getting started

**Issues are used to create feature requests or bug reports.** You can create an
issue [here](https://github.com/pipebird/pipebird/issues). We ask that you check
to see if an existing issue covers what you had in mind. If there isn't anything
similar, then please fire it off!

#### Feature requests

Potential areas for feature requests are new

- sources
- destinations
- transformations

We encourage you to add reactions to existing issues so we can assess their
priority.

👀 = extremely urgent.  
👍 = would be nice to get this done.

Feature requests can be created
[here](https://github.com/pipebird/pipebird/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature%5Frequest.md&title=).

#### Bug reports

‌Bug reports are essential to the improvement of Pipebird. When creating a bug
report, please provide anything that may be helpful such as screenshots,
recordings, and a detailed account of the issue.

Bug reports can be created
[here](https://github.com/pipebird/pipebird/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug%5Freport.md&title=).

#### Reporting security issues

If you've identified a security issue, please email us directly at
[sales@pipebird.com](mailto:sales@pipebird.com)

#### Pull requests

Please make sure that all PRs are related to an existing issue. If there is not
yet a related issue, you can create one
[here](https://github.com/pipebird/pipebird/issues).

Once a PR is submitted, it will be reviewed by a Pipebird team member. During a
review we ask:

- Does the PR solve the related issue?
- Is there a more robust way to solve this?
- Has this been tested?
- Are there any security risks being created?

One a PR is reviewed and accepted, it will be merged.

We're excited to build with you 🛠🛠🛠
