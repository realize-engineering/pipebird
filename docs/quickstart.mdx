#### We support three deployment methods.

1. **VPC Deployment** enables you to deploy a Pipebird box inside your
   pre-existing VPC.
2. **Default Deployment** will deploy a public Pipebird box inside your default
   VPC.
3. **Local Deployment** will deploy to your local machine.

We recommend **Default Deployment** if your app is not yet running within AWS.

#### Obtain a license key

Sign up to [get a license key here](https://my.pipebird.com) \- you'll need to
enter this key into the Quick Setup flow later in the process.

#### VPC Deployment

To deploy within an existing VPC click
[here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-lglxt2zjl1jo-us-east-1/pipebird%5Fexisting%5Fcloud%5Fdeploy&stackName=pipebird&param%5FlicenseKey=lk%5Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff).

#### Default Deployment

For our default deployment strategy we will spin up Pipebird within a default
subnet. In case you don't have a default subnet, follow the below steps to
create one.

First, install the aws-cli

```bash Terminal
brew install awscli
```

Next, configure your aws account locally

```bash Terminal
aws configure
```

Then, create a default subnet

```bash Terminal
aws ec2 create-default-subnet --availability-zone us-east-1a
```

#### Finally, to deploy Pipebird simply click [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-lglxt2zjl1jo-us-east-1/pipebird%5Fsimple%5Fdeploy&stackName=pipebird&param%5FlicenseKey=lk%5Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff).

Pipebird's server will be running on port 3000 of the newly created instance.
You can find the code for the server in your absolute path: /pipebird.

#### Get secret key

After creating your EC2 instance, you will need to use the following command to
create your pipebird-secret-key:

```bash Terminal
scp -i ~/Downloads/test-datawarehouse-bastion.pem ubuntu@3.238.148.71:~/pipebird/.env pipebird-secret-key && clear && cat pipebird-secret-key | grep "^SECRET_KEY" && rm pipebird-secret-key
```

You can use this secret key bearer token defined in this file to make authorized
requests against your Pipebird instance.

#### Troubleshooting

Check your CloudFormation stack and CloudTrail logs for details on why a build
may have failed.

#### Local Deploy

<Note>
  Required environment variables are specified in `lib/env.ts` and
  `.env.example` \- make sure to fill out `DATABASE_URL` before attempting to
  run migrations.
</Note>

<Note>
  Pipebird requires Node >= 16, a running Postgres instance, and a running Redis
  server to function.
</Note>

You can also run Pipebird locally after cloning the repo by running the
following:

```bash Terminal
npm install
npm run build
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm start
```
